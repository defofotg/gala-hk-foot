# Soccer Association Management Application

## Introduction
Briefly introduce your application. Explain its main purpose, which in this case is to manage various activities of a soccer association including presence record management, after match lunches, trips and tournaments funding, and season statistics.

## Features
List the key features of your application. For example:
- **Presence Record Management:** Track and manage player and staff attendance for various events.
- **After Match Lunches:** Organize and manage post-match lunches, including venues, menus, and attendees.
- **Trips and Tournaments Funding:** Handle the financial aspects of trips and tournaments including budgeting, expenses, and sponsorships.
- **Season Statistics:** Maintain and display statistics for the season including player performance, team rankings, and more.

## Specifications  
### Season and Team Setup  
-  **Initial Setup:** At the start of the season, the organizer is required to form two teams that will compete every Sunday for a year.
-  **Team Composition:** Each team must have a name and consist of at least 11 players. 
-  **Unique Identification:** Each player is assigned a unique jersey number within their team. 

### Match Scheduling and Management
- **Weekly Matches:** Matches are scheduled every Sunday, starting at 14:00 and concluding by 17:00. ### Attendance Record Management  
-  **Creation of Attendance Lists:** Every Sunday from 18:00, an attendance list for the next week's match is generated. This can be done manually by the organizer or will be automatically generated by 23:59 in case of no action from the organizer. 
-  **Player Attendance Declarations:** Players can declare their attendance status as either 'present and on time', 'present and late', 'present for snacks', or 'absent'. 
-  **Deadline for Declarations:** Players must finalize their attendance status by midnight on the day of the match (Sunday). Post this deadline, the attendance list cannot be altered. 
-  **Visibility and Accessibility:** The attendance list is accessible to all members and is visible at all times from its creation until the end of the match. It highlights present players (by name and jersey number) in the order of their declaration. A separate list includes those who declared themselves absent or present only for snacks.
